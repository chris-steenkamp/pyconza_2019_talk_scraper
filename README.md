# PyConZA 2019 Talk Scraper

~~The current PyConZA [conference page](https://za.pycon.org/) doesn't provide a convenient way to view the various tracks and their associated talks (and times).~~ As of 2019/10/04 (the day after I wrote the scraper), this information is available on the PyConZA website ðŸ˜‚.

This utility can be used to extract the details of the various talks. It makes this information available as a list of talk dictionary objects which can then be transformed into a more meaningful view.
