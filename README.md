# PyConZA 2019 Talk Scraper

The current PyConZA [conference page](https://za.pycon.org/) doesn't provide a convenient way to view the various tracks and their associated talks (and times). This utility extracts the details of the various talks and makes this information available as a list of talk dictionary objects which can then be transformed into a more meaningful view.
